 *
 * This is a 3D implementation of QuickHull based on the original paper by Barber, Dobkin, and Huhdanpaa and the C implementation known as qhull.
 * The algorithm has O(n log(n)) complexity, works with double precision numbers, is fairly robust with respect to degenerate situations, and allows the merging of co-planar faces.
